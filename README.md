### This repo contains a number of my examples of work.
## Content
- **Manual_of_Admin_tool.pdf** is a common example of what i was responsible for. It is created and exported from *Confluence*, so page layout differs a little from the original view. The main users of Admin tool are product owners, customer support managers and stakeholders.
- **Guide_how_to_bet.pdf** is a step-by-step end-user guide.
- **Release_notes** contains the commercial release notes, developed as a test task for applying to the company. It was developed as a HTML-page to show some of my technical background.
